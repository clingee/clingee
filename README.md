Stolen and lost cell phones could cost American consumers more than $30 billion this year, cLingee secures your iPhone against theft.



Location

cLingee captures the location information. When cLingee detects a location change relative to the nearest cell tower, if the iPhone status is already set to Missing and geolocation is activated, you will be able to detect the iPhones location and it will be presented on the cLingee website in addition to an image of the devices surroundings or whoever is holding the iPhone at the moment. The cLingee website is accessible via laptops, tablets and mobile devices with web connectivity.

As with any Theft scenario, SAFETY FIRST! Do not attempt to confront an individual suspected of stealing your phone even if you know who they are. If in a public place, use sound judgment. Always call the police when in doubt.


Picture

cLingee captures the image using the front facing camera on the iPhone. When activated, cLingee will capture image information in addition to the geographic location. cLingee then attaches the geo-coordinates to the images captured onto any mapping application including google maps which cLingee uses as a default.

Alarm and Vibration

cLingee will also set off the alarm if this option is selected. In case you simply misplaced your iPhone or you suspect the theft happened within close vicinity such as a doctors office or bookstore or any public place, you may simply use this feature by accessing the cLingee site from any available mobile device or computer.

Using any IDE that supports apple development, NetBeans, Java etc for cross compatibility. 
The zip files contain both the front end UI and the Server backend side, in addition to the installable iPhone App. YOu can either install this on your iPhone or put it in your apple / itune store. For those with a jailbroken device well...feel free to have at it!

Additionally, you can customize, modify, improve, and make changes but REMEMBER it is an open source application first and foremost under the GNU V 2.0 license.

The logical implementation and how they are connected is created in Django/Python, so if you want to add a new page you need some python skills, but for editing existing page that should be enough if you have basic HTML knowledge
